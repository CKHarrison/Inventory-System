This is an Inventory System project for WGU. The idea is that a product is made up of at least one or more parts, with no duplicate parts. There is a linear search functionality which lets you search for parts or products. You can add or delete parts and products, as well as edit the composition of a product, and a part. This was created with Java and JavaFX.

I would like to add more functionality to this project as well as refactor some of the code to make it more modular and editable.

TODO:

Link into an SQL backend to create permanant storage of parts and products.

Put the search functionality into it's own package.

Upgrade the look of the GUI, make it more professional.

Change the linear search to a more efficent search algorithm. Maybe a binary search.
